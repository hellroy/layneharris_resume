Bravo Tango is made up of six interactive, repeatable exercises targeted to help with specific challenges military veterans may face, including trouble sleeping, anxiety, and loneliness. The goal of the application was to ease the transition home after deployment and minimize barriers for veterans who want to work on their own mental health.
    
-   Adaptoys – For the Christopher Reeves Foundation we developed the Adaptoys program to raise awareness about the lack of toys available for the disabled community by hacking popular toys to make them accessible for people with mobility issues.

-   Oreo Daily Twist – American Eagle Billboard – Times Square - As part of the Oreo Daily Twist campaign, 360i developed an on‐site advertising studio where we took Daily Twist suggestions from social media and created real-‐‐time content to celebrate the last day of the popular program. The finalists were displayed on the billboard, and fans were encouraged to vote on their favorite Twist. The votes were dynamically tallied in real‐time on the display until the winner was revealed.
    
-   Hanes Undercover Color – ABC Billboard – Times Square - For the Hanes Undercover Color program, women were asked to share the color of their underwear via social media using the program hashtag and a hashtag representing the color. The hashtags were aggregated programmatically and after some data analysis a trending color was determined. Every fifteen minutes, the ABC sign displayed a new animated movie based on the trending color, along a stream of user tweets associated with the program hashtag.
